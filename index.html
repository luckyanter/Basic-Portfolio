  	  <img src="assests/images/6.jpeg">
  	  <p>Hello to all human race from the animal 
         kindom.
         We are a fun group of highly energetic animals that are starting to learn full stack web development at Bora Bora zoo.
         I am Alex the horse and I am sharing the profile of my family in my portfolio.
         We do believe that our journey is challenging but we are dedicated to finish it.
         Some are doing it for fun, others for knowledge, but I want to be a professional developer.
         Other than racing other horses, I do have passsion for developing.
         So wish us luck and share your knowledge.
         Also if you read my profile and liked what you see, it would be great if you have internship for us.
         This is the production of our first week  in class.
         Special thanks  to the eagle who instructs us and to his three knowledgable assisstants.
         In the next two pages,you will find my contact info and my portfolio.
